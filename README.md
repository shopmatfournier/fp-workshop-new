A whirlwind tour through some big hits in scala

- to install SBT just do `brew install sbt` 
- You will need to have JDK 11 installed.  `dev up` should do this for you in this repo 
    - test your install: go to the root github dir of this project and type `sbt compile` and it should work 
- you can use IntelliJ Community Edition + the scala plugin to open this repository (file -> new project and point it at the root github directory).  It should import the project for you automatically
- you can also use vscode + the METALS plugin
    - make a new workspace and add this github repository local dir to the workspace
		- it should automatically start importing or a popup in the lower right will ask you if you want to import the scala project
